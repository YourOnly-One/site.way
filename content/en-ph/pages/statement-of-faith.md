<p>This page gives an overview of what I <i>presently</i> believe in. This serves as my <b>Statement of Faith</b>. I did my best to keep this as short, simple, and straight as possible.</p>

<p>If you are a family, relative, friend, and/or neighbour, and you are <i>shocked</i> about this, feel free to ask me and I will answer your questions to the best of the knowledge our Creator Father <bdi dir="rtl" lang="hbo-Hebr">𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄</bdi> (YAHUAH/YaHuWaH) has provided.</p>

<!--
because it is not the same as the "Christians" of the Apostles or more correctly called "HaDerech" ([Followers of] The Way) or "Natsarim" (a.k.a. "YAHudim", "YAHuwan", "Hebrew Israelite", "[Original] Israelite faith", "Apostolic", and/or "Apostolic-Christianity").

<h2>Concise</h2>
<ol class="custom_liststyle rounded-list">
  <li>Abba's (The Father in Heaven) Name is <bdi dir="rtl" lang="hbo-Hebr">𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄</bdi> (pronounced as "yah-hu-ah"; transliterated as "YAHUAH", "YaHuWaH", or "YHWH"); and the Messiah's Name is <bdi dir="rtl" lang="hbo-Hebr">𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤔𐤅𐤏</bdi> (pronunciation: yah-hu-shua; transliteration: Yahushua; also read: <a title="Messiah's Name: Yahushua or Yahusha?" href="https://only.1way.faith/p/name-messiah-yahushua.html">Messiah's Name: Yahushua or Yahusha?</a>).
    <p>I am <b><i>not</i></b> a "Sacred Namer".</p>
  </li>

  <li>I believe we should obey the Torah of <bdi dir="rtl" lang="hbo-Hebr">𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄</bdi> (YAHUAH) but reject the "traditions of men" or any [religious] traditions.
    <p>I am <b><i>not</i></b> a member of any sect of "Judaism".</p>
  </li>
  <li>I believe we should observe and practice the 7 Appointed Times (commonly known as the 7 Feasts) of <bdi dir="rtl" lang="hbo-Hebr">𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄</bdi> (YAHUAH/YaHuWaH).
    <ul class="custom_liststyle checkmark list-green">
      <li>We should not observe nor participate in any feasts in the Gregorian calendar or those declared by the State/government. These are not in the Scripture and is forbidden.</li>
      <li>We should not observe birthdays as this is a self-centric celebration.</li>
      <li>We should not observe anniversaries which does not glorify YAH.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>I believe that we should observe the true 7<sup>th</sup> Day Sabbath as revealed and instructed in the Scripture, based on the luni-solar calendar (herein referred to as the "Scriptural Calendar"; it is also important to note that it is <b>not</b> and is <i>different</i> from the "lunar calendar").</li>

  <li>I believe in Salvation as taught by Kepha (Peter) in Acts 2:38 and by Sha'ul (Paul) in 1 Corinthians 15:1-4. It is only by believing, baptism in water in the name of <bdi dir="rtl" lang="hbo-Hebr">𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤔𐤅𐤏</bdi> (Yahushua), and receiving the Set-apart Ruah (Holy Spirit), that we are saved.
    <p>I fully reject the "once saved, always saved" doctrine.</p>
  </li>

  <li>I believe in <b>Remnant Theology</b> that the "gentiles" were grafted into the Olive Tree of Israel and has become part of and citizen of the Israel of <bdi dir="rtl" lang="hbo-Hebr">𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄</bdi> (YAHUAH/YaHuWaH).
    <p>I fully reject the "Replacement Theology" popular within Denominational-Christianity (a.k.a. "Protestant" (protesting against the Vatican yet retaining many of their traditions and dogma), "Born-Again", "Pentecostal", "Christendom", "Catholic" (universal faith), and so on).</p>
  </li>

  <li>I am a <b>Hebrew-Israelite <abbr class="popper animate" data-popper="branch; watcher">Natsari</abbr></b> (plural: <b>Natsarim</b>), a HaDerech ([Follower of] The Way), as spoken of by the Prophets and in the <abbr class="popper animate" data-popper="Apostles">Shelihim</abbr> Writings (a.k.a. New Testament or the Renewed Covenant).</li>

  <li>I do not identify with "Denominational-Christianity". It was:
    <ul class="custom_liststyle omark-black list-red">
      <li>Founded by those who disagreed with Peter and/or Paul, and/or the Jerusalem Council.</li>
      <li>Formalised by Emperor Constantine and the bishops, among others, and solidified during the infamous Council of Nicaea.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>I believe the world was divided by Noah between his three sons--Yapheth (Japheth), Shem, and Ham.
    <ul class="custom_liststyle checkmark-heavy list-green">
      <li>Yapheth (Japheth) ("fair") acquired the modern regions of "Central America", "North America", "Europe", "Russia" ("Siberia" not included), and the Western part of "Turkey".</li>
      <li>Shem ("dusky"/"brown") inherited what we call today "Asia", "Siberia", and the Eastern part of "Turkey" but not "Indonesia".</li>
      <li>Ham ("black") was given the lands we call today as "Africa", "South America", "Australia", and "Indonesia".</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>I believe the ancient Israelites were brown people--not black nor white--the first color of the human skin which Shem's descendants mostly retained to this day (due to the climate in their inherited lands). However, we must not forget Shemoth (Exodus) 12:38.</li>

  <li>I believe that the Filipino people are Hebrews from the line of Yoktan (Joktan)--in particular his youngest sons Sheba, Ophir, Havilah, and [possibly] Yobab--second son of Eber (from whence "Hebrew" came). Yoktan's lineage are also called the "Eastern Hebrews".</li>
  <li>I believe that the majority of the Filipino people are also descendants of the ancient Northern Kingdom of Israel (the so-called "10 Lost Tribes of Israel") who mostly migrated in ancient Philippines, then called "Ophir", and lived amongst their cousins--the Eastern Hebrews. (Some stayed in the area we call today as "Kurdistan".)</li>
  <li>I believe that the Tribes of the ancient Southern Kingdom of Israel, also later called as Judea, migrated to Central--and some parts of Southern--Africa in what was then the coast-to-coast Kingdom of Ethiopia. These tribes were specifically targeted in the slave trade and Ham's descendants were largely ignored.</li>

    <p><sup>1</sup>Now concerning spiritual things, brothers, I do not want you to be ignorant. <sup>2</sup>You know that when you were heathen, you were led away to those mute idols, however you might be led. <sup>3</sup>Therefore I make known to you that no man speaking by the Ruah of Elohim says, "<bdi dir="rtl" lang="hbo-Hebr">𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤔𐤅𐤏</bdi> is accursed." No one can say, "<bdi dir="rtl" lang="hbo-Hebr">𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤔𐤅𐤏</bdi> is Master," but by the Set-apart Ruah. <sup>4</sup>Now there are various kinds of gifts, but the same Ruah.</p>
